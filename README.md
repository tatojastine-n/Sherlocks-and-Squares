# Sherlocks-and-Squares
This C# program counts the number of perfect squares within a given range `[a, b]`. The `squares` function finds the smallest integer whose square is at least `a` and the largest integer whose square is at most `b`, then calculates how many squares exist between them. The `Main` method reads multiple queries, calls the function for each range, and outputs the results.
